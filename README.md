# goodreadsExtension




 Chrome extention that calculates the percentile that the ratings for a given book is on goodreads.

Utilises the scraped goodreads dataset located here ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks ) to calculate the ratings. As of 2019ish? Goodreads has stopped API support and as such I no longer have recent data. This may make calculations unreliable.
